Imagine you are a health young college student. All of the sudden you caught a pneumonia, and now you need to take antibiotics for the next 7 days. This is a new routine that you are not use to, on top of the mid term stress, you need to remember another one more thing. We aim to build a app, that will integrate image recognition, and automatically build a calendar to remind you to take your mediation on time. Taking your meds on time helps your recover, and missing them can harm you. Studies shown that 7-20% of patients miss their scheduled medications, and miss dose of antobotics lead to resistance. We hope to change that.
